        Fela Kuti, best known as the pioneer of Afrobeat. Fela used his music to
        critique political corruption and social injustice in Nigeria. Despite
        facing adversity, Fela's influential music legacy and activism have left
        an enduring impact on African and global music and social movements.

          <h1>1938</h1>
          <p>
            Born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti into the Ransome-Kuti
            family, an upper-middle-class Nigerian family, on 15 October 1938 in
            Abeokuta (the modern-day capital of Ogun State), which at the time
            was a city in the British Colony of Nigeria. His mother, Chief
            Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was an anti-colonial feminist, and his
            father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican
            minister, school principal, and the first president of the Nigeria
            Union of Teachers. Kuti's parents both played active roles in the
            anti-colonial movement in Nigeria, most notably the Abeokuta Women's
            Riots which was led by his mother in 1946. His brothers Beko
            Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, both medical doctors, were
            well known nationally. Kuti Is a cousin to the writer and laureate
            Wole Soyinka, a Nobel Prize for Literature winner. They are both
            descendants of Josiah Ransome-Kuti, who is Kuti's paternal
            grandfather and Soyinka's maternal great-grandfather.

          <p>
            In 1958, he was sent to London to study medicine but decided to
            study music instead at the Trinity College of Music, with the
            trumpet being his preferred instrument. While there, he formed the
            band Koola Lobitos and played a fusion of jazz and highlife. In
            1960, Kuti married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with
            whom he had three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola). In 1963, Kuti
            moved back to the newly independent Federation of Nigeria, re-formed
            Koola Lobitos, and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian
            Broadcasting Corporation. He played for some time with Victor Olaiya
            and his All-Stars. He called his style Afrobeat, a combination of
            Fuji music, funk, jazz, highlife, salsa, calypso, and traditional
            Yoruba music. In 1969, Kuti took the band to the United States and
            spent ten months in Los Angeles. While there, he discovered the
            Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now known as Sandra
            Izsadore or Sandra Akanke Isidore), a partisan of the Black Panther
            Party. This experience heavily influenced his music and political
            views. He renamed the band Nigeria 70. Soon after, the Immigration
            and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter that Kuti
            and his band were in the US without work permits. The band performed
            a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be
            released as The '69 Los Angeles Sessions.

          <h1>1970-1972</h1>
          <p>
            After Kuti and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed
            (the) Africa '70 as lyrical themes changed from love to social
            issues. He formed the Kalakuta Republic, a commune, recording
            studio, and home for many people connected to the band—which he
            later declared independent from the Nigerian state. Kuti set up a
            nightclub in the Empire Hotel, first named the Afro-Spot and later
            the Afrika Shrine, where he both performed regularly and officiated
            at personalised Yoruba traditional ceremonies in honor of his native
            ancestral faith. He also changed his name to Anikulapo (meaning "He
            who carries death in his pouch", with the interpretation: "I will be
            the master of my own destiny and will decide when it is time for
            death to take me"). He stopped using the hyphenated surname
            "Ransome" because he considered it a slave name.[citation needed]
            Kuti's music was popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in
            general. He decided to sing in Pidgin English so that individuals
            all over Africa could enjoy his music, where the local languages
            they speak are diverse and numerous. As popular as Kuti's music had
            become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was unpopular with the ruling
            government, and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. During
            1972, Ginger Baker recorded Stratavarious, with Kuti appearing
            alongside vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench. Around this time, Kuti
            became even more involved with the Yoruba religion.

          <h1>1977</h1>
          <p>
            In 1977, Kuti and Africa 70 released the album Zombie, which heavily
            criticized Nigerian soldiers, and used the zombie metaphor to
            describe the Nigerian military's methods. The album was a massive
            success and infuriated the government, who raided the Kalakuta
            Republic with 1,000 soldiers. During the raid, Kuti was severely
            beaten, and his elderly mother (the first woman to drive a car in
            Nigeria) was fatally injured after being thrown from a window. The
            commune was burnt down, and Kuti's studio, instruments, and master
            tapes were destroyed. Kuti claimed that he would have been killed
            had it not been for a commanding officer's intervention as he was
            being beaten. Kuti's response to the attack was to deliver his
            mother's coffin to the Dodan Barracks in Lagos, General Olusegun
            Obasanjo's residence, and to write two songs, "Coffin for Head of
            State" and "Unknown Soldier," referencing the official inquiry that
            claimed an unknown soldier had destroyed the commune.

            Kuti and his band took up residence in Crossroads Hotel after the
            Shrine had been destroyed along with the commune. In 1978, he
            married 27 women, many of whom were dancers, composers, and singers
            with whom he worked. The marriages served not only to mark the
            anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic but also to
            protect Kuti and his wives from authorities' false claims that Kuti
            was kidnapping women. Later, he adopted a rotation system of
            maintaining 12 simultaneous wives. There were also two concerts that
            year the first was in Accra, in which rioting broke out during the
            song "Zombie", which caused Kuti to be banned from entering Ghana,
            the second was after the Berlin Jazz Festival when most of Kuti's
            musicians deserted him due to rumours that he planned to use all of
            the proceeds to fund his presidential campaign. In 1978 Fela
            performed at the Berliner Jazztage in Berlin with his band Africa
            70. Disappointed by their fees, Tony Allen, the band leader and
            almost all the musicians resigned. Since then, Baryton player Lekan
            Animashaun became band leader and Fela created a new group named
            Egypt80. In 1979, Kuti formed his political party, which he called
            Movement of the People (MOP), to "clean up society like a mop", but
            it quickly became inactive due to his confrontations with the
            government of the day. MOP preached Nkrumahism and Africanism.

            In 1980 Fela signed an exclusive management with french producer
            Martin Meissonnier who secured a record deal with Arista records
            London through A&R Tarquin Gotch. The first album came out in
            February 1981 under the title of "Black President" with the track
            "ITT" and on the B-Side "Colonial Mentality" and an edited version
            of "Sorrow Tears and Blood" (these two tracks recorded with Africa
            70 and Tony Allen were unreleased in Europe). Following the release,
            Fela performed his first European tour (4 concerts in a week) with a
            suite of 70 people. The tour starting in Paris on March 15th 1981
            with a huge crowd estimated at 10000 people, then Brussels, Wien and
            Strasbourg. "Black President was followed by another album was
            recorded in Paris in july 1981: "Original Sufferhead", with "Power
            Show" on the B-side. Fela also recorded the track "Perambulator" in
            Paris. Arista gave his back freedom to Fela at the end of 1981.
            French Filmmaker Jean Jacques Flori came to Lagos early 1982 to
            direct the now classic film "Music is a Weapon". The film was
            broadcast first on Antenne 2 (french TV in 1982). The film producer
            Stephane Tchalgaldjieff didn't like the film and decided to re edit
            it for an international release. "V.I.P. (Vagabonds in Power)" and
            "Authority Stealing" were released in 1980, with the former being a
            live performance done in Berlin, West Germany.

            In 1983, Kuti nominated himself for president in Nigeria's first
            elections in decades, but his candidature was refused. At this time,
            Kuti created a new band, Egypt 80, which reflected the view that
            Egyptian civilization, knowledge, philosophy, mathematics, and
            religious systems are African and must be claimed as such. Kuti
            stated in an interview: "Stressing the point that I have to make
            Africans aware of the fact that Egyptian civilization belongs to the
            African. So that was the reason why I changed the name of my band to
            Egypt 80." Kuti continued to record albums and tour the country. He
            further infuriated the political establishment by implicating ITT
            Corporation's vice-president, Moshood Abiola, and Obasanjo in the
            popular 25-minute political screed entitled "I.T.T. (International
            Thief-Thief)". In 1984, Muhammadu Buhari's government, of which Kuti
            was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency smuggling.
            Amnesty International and others denounced the charges as
            politically motivated. Amnesty designated him a prisoner of
            conscience, and other human rights groups also took up his case.
            After 20 months, General Ibrahim Babangida released him from prison.
            On his release, Kuti divorced his 12 remaining wives, citing
            "marriage brings jealousy and selfishness" since his wives would
            regularly compete for superiority.

          <h1>1986-1993</h1>
          <p>
            Kuti continued to release albums with Egypt 80 and toured in the
            United States and Europe while continuing to be politically active.
            In 1986, he performed in Giants Stadium in New Jersey as part of
            Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope concert along with
            Bono, Carlos Santana, and the Neville Brothers. In 1989, Kuti and
            Egypt 80 released the anti-apartheid album Beasts of No Nation that
            depicted U.S. President Ronald Reagan, UK Prime Minister Margaret
            Thatcher, and South African State President Pieter Willem Botha on
            its cover. The title of the composition evolved out of a statement
            by Botha: "This uprising [against the apartheid system] will bring
            out the beast in us." Kuti's album output slowed in the 1990s, and
            eventually, he ceased releasing albums altogether. On 21 January
            1993, he and four members of Africa 70 were arrested and were later
            charged on 25 January for the murder of an electrician. Rumours also
            speculated that he was suffering from an illness for which he was
            refusing treatment. However, there had been no confirmed statement
            from Kuti about this speculation.

            On 3 August 1997, Kuti's brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a
            prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, announced
            that Kuti had died on the previous day from complications related to
            AIDS. Kuti had been an AIDS denialist, and his widow maintained
            that he did not die of AIDS. His youngest son Seun took the
            role of leading Kuti's former band Egypt 80. As of 2022, the band is
            still active, releasing music under the moniker Seun Kuti & Egypt
            80.
